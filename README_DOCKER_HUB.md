## Getting Help & Reporting Issues

If you have issues running the controller, feel free to [create a Help discussion](https://github.com/mbentley/docker-omada-controller/discussions/categories/help) and I will help as I can. If you are specifically having a problem that is related to the actual software, I would suggest filing an issue on the [TP-Link community forums](https://community.tp-link.com/en/business/forum/582) as I do not have access to source code to debug those issues. If you're not sure where the problem might be, I can help determine if it is a running in Docker issue or a software issue. If you're certain you have found a bug, create a [Bug Report Issue](https://github.com/mbentley/docker-omada-controller/issues/new/choose).
